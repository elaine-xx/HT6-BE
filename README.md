## About
Blink is an advanced mobile app that auditory describes any user-taken images, revolutionizing the way millions of visually impaired individuals "see" & interact with their surroundings. Through a simple double-tap on the screen, users capture images that are then comprehensively analyzed by the AI to provide an auditory description. Tapping & Holding the screen enables users to ask an embedded AI Agent follow-up questions about the image.<br><br>Blink empowers the visually impaired by offering them an independent means to perceive their environment.

## How It Works
Blink's user-interface is simple and incredibly easy to use, catering to the visually impaired. The app is driven by Flutter and Dart on the front-end, and Python and Flask in the back-end. It leverages the Replicate library to curate an interaction history, and facilitates seamless communication with the MiniGPT-4 API. Articulate responses are vocalized from the AI model, and the app showcases on-screen outputs in real time.
